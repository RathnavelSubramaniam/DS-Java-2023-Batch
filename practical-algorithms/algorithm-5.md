# Problem Statement:

5.	Write a program that illustrates method overloading

## Algorithm:

1.	Define the class "OverloadDemo" and define the method "test" within the class
2.	If no parameters are passed to the method, execute the following code:
	2.1 Print the message "No parameters" using System.out.println()
3. If two integer parameters are passed to the method, execute the following code:
3.1 Print the message "a and b: " concatenated with the values of "a" and "b" using System.out.println()
4. If a double parameter is passed to the method, execute the following code:
4.1 Print the message "Inside test(double) a: " concatenated with the value of "a" using System.out.println()
	5. Define the class "Overload" with main method 
	6. Create an instance of the "OverloadDemo" class named "ob"
	7. Declare an integer variable "i" and assign it the value 88. 
8. Call the "test" method on the "ob" instance without passing any parameters to test the 
    method overload with no parameters. 
9. Call the "test" method on the "ob" instance and pass the integer values 10 and 20 as 
   parameters to test the method overload with two integer parameters.
10. Call the "test" method on the "ob" instance and pass the double value 123.2 as a
    parameter to test the method overload with a double parameter

## Sample Output:
