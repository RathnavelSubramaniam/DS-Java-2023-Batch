## Problem Statement

1.	Find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of its two opposing sides




## Algorithm

1.	Initialize the side 1 value as 3.0 in a variable called "side1".
2.	Initialize the side 2 value as 4.0 in a variable called "side2".
3.	Compute the square of "side1" and "side2” by using pow () method from the class called Math and reinitialize the variables with result.
4.	Get the sum of "side1" and "side2” and store it in a variable called "hypotenuse_squared".
5.	Take the square root of "hypotenuse_squared" and, after that, display it to the user as output.
