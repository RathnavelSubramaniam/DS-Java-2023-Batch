## Problem Statement

1.	Find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of its two opposing sides




## Algorithm



1.	Define the class “area” with the main method 
2.	Declare variable PI as double and initialize with a value of 3.14159 
3.	Declare variable radius as double and initialize with a value of 10
4.	Calculate the area of circle using the formula: area= PI * radius*radius
5.	Display the value of area as output
