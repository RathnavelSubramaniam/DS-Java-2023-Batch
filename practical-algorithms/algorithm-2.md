## Problem Statement

2.	Write a program to find Season using if-else-if and switch statements

## Algorithm:( if-else-if Statement) : [Optional]

1. Define the class "IfElse” with the main method within the class
2.	Declare an integer variable "month" and assign it the value 4.
3.	Start if-else statement, Check the condition if "month" is equal to 12 OR 1 OR 2
4.	If true, execute the following code
	4.1 Assign the value "Winter" to the variable "season”
5. If false, proceed to the next condition. if "month" is equal to 3 OR 4 OR 5
	5.1 If true, Assign the value "Spring" to the variable "season”
6. If false, proceed to the next condition if "month" is equal to 6 OR 7 OR 8
	6.1 If true, Assign the value "Summer" to the variable "season”
7. If false, proceed to the next condition if "month" is equal to 9 OR 10 OR 11
	7.1 If true, Assign the value "Autumn" to the variable "season"
8. Assign the value "Bogus Month" to the variable "season" if any other value in "month”
9. Print the message "April is in the " concatenated with the value of "season"



## Algorithm: (Switch Statement):
1.	Define the class "Example" and Declare the main method within the class
2.	Declare an integer variable "month" and assign it the value 4
3.	Start the switch statement with the variable "month" as the expression
4.	Declare a String variable "season"
5.	Execute the following code for cases 12, 1, and 2:
	5.1 Assign the value "Winter" to the variable "season”
	5.2 Exit the switch statement using the "break" keyword
6. Execute the following code for cases 3, 4, and 5:
	6.1 Assign the value "Spring" to the variable "season"
	6.2 Exit the switch statement using the "break" keyword
7. Execute the following code for cases 6, 7, and 8:
7.1 Assign the value "Summer" to the variable "season"
7.2 Exit the switch statement using the "break" keyword
8. Execute the following code for cases 9, 10, and 11:
8.1 Assign the value " Autumn " to the variable "season"
8.2 Exit the switch statement using the "break" keyword
9. Execute the following code for any other value of "month”:
9.1 Assign the value "Bogus Month" to the variable "season”
9.2 Exit the switch statement using the "break" keyword
10. Print the message "April is in the " concatenated with the value of "season"
