## Problem Statement:

7.	Write a program that uses inheritance to extend Box class to include a variable “weight”

## Algorithm:
1.	Define a parent class called Box with the desired attributes and method for a basic box
2.	In the Box class, declare instance variables to represent the dimensions of the box, such as length, width, and height. Also, define method called volume
3.	Create a child class called WeightedBox that extends the Box class
4.	In the WeightedBox class, add an additional instance variable called weight to represent the weight of the box
5.	Provide appropriate constructors in both the Box and WeightedBox classes to initialize the respective instance variables
6.	Use inheritance to inherit the attributes and methods of the Box class in the WeightedBox class
7.	In main method, create an object mybox1 for subclass to Invoke the method in WeightedBox class
