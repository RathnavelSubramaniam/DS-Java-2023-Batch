| 3. Write a Java program to find the factorial of a number using recursion   |   |  | [Practical 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/GcwoUS4P) / [Algorithm/Pseudocode](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-3.md)   |
| 4.Write a Java program that invoke the Box class created with a method named “volume” from 2 Box objects                |  |   | [Practical 4](https://classroom.github.com/a/vKXqvP5s) / [Algorithm/Pseudocode](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-4.md)   |
| 5.Write a program that illustrates method overloading|   |  | [Practical 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/vtGLEG_F) / [Algorithm/Pseudocode](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-5.md)   |
| 6.Write a program to demonstrate how the command-line arguments are accessed inside a Java program  |   |  | [Practical 6](https://classroom.github.com/a/qE9PXPxg) / [Algorithm/Pseudocode](./practical-algorithms/ algorithm-6.md)   |

| 8. Create a program with a superclass called Figure that defines a method called area( ) which computes the area of an object. Then derives two subclasses from Figure. The first is Rectangle and the second is Triangle. Each of these subclasses overrides area( ) so that it returns the area of a rectangle and a triangle, respectively                                |   |  | [Practical 8](https://classroom.github.com/a/3Dcw9-wQ) / [Algorithm/Pseudocode](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-8.md)   |
