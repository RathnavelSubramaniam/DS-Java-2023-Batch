# Introduction to Data Structures, Variables, Data Types

**Variables:**

- Variables are used to store data, and they can hold different types of data, depending on the data type that you specify.
- Variables are given names so that you can refer to them later in your code.
- Naming variables is based on some rules and conventions that should be followed to write meaningful and self-explanatory code.

**Data Types:**

- A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can hold.
- In Java, there are two types of data: `primitive data types and reference/object data types.`
  - Primitive data types are used to store basic data values (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double).
  - reference/object data types are derived from classes and they are not available by default, we need to create a class for it, then it can be stored in the variable like Strings, arrays.
