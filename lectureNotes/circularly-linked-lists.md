Circular Linked List

Circular Linked List Insertion and Deletion

A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node points to the first node, creating a loop. This allows for circular traversal and makes it useful for creating circular buffers.

Insertion
Inserting a new node at the beginning of the list involves creating a new node, setting its next reference to the current head node, and updating the head to point to the new node. The last node's next reference should be updated to point to the new node, completing the circular loop.

Inserting a new node at the end of the list involves creating a new node, setting its next reference to the head node, and updating the next reference of the current last node to point to the new node. The new node should become the last node.

Deletion
Deleting a node from the beginning of the list involves updating the head node to point to the next node, setting the next reference of the last node to point to the new head node, and deleting the old head node.

Deleting a node from the end of the list involves traversing the list to find the second-to-last node, updating its next reference to point to the head node, and deleting the old last node.
