# What is an Algorithm? Asymptotic Notations and its Types

**Algorithms:**

- An algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output.
- The goal of an algorithm is to solve a specific problem, and it can be implemented in any programming language.
- It's very much necessary to balance the time complexity and space complexity when implementing algorithms as it directly impacts the performance of the code.

**Analysis of Algorithms:**

- The analysis of algorithms involves determining the amount of resources (time and space) needed to solve a problem using a specific algorithm.
- By evaluating and comparing the performance of different algorithms, we can choose the most efficient one for our needs.
- The process of analyzing an algorithm involves counting the number of basic operations performed, measuring the time taken to execute, and calculating the space (memory) used.
- The aim is to balance the space and time complexity of the algorithm. Time-complexity is evaluated by counting the number of basic operations and this is dependent on the size of the input, space complexity is the amount of memory needed to execute the program, this also depends on the size of the input.
- A common way to measure the performance of an algorithm is by using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's time or space complexity.
- O(n) is linear time, meaning the time it takes to solve the problem increases linearly with the size of the input. O(log n) is logarithmic time, meaning it takes longer to solve larger inputs, but it grows more slowly than linear time.

In conclusion, the analysis of algorithms is important to ensuring that our programs run as efficiently as possible. It's a way to evaluate and compare the performance of algorithms in terms of time and space, so we can choose the best one for our needs. The Big O notation is a widely used notation used to calculate the upper bound of execution time and memory consumed.
