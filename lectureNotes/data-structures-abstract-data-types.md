# Introduction to Data Structures and Abstract Data Types

**Data Structures:**

A Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. The data structure can be divided into two main types, i.e., Linear Data structure and Non-Linear Data structure.
whereas

**Abstract Data Types(ADTs):**

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a theoretical concept used to define a data type's behavior from the point of view of the user. It specifies the operations that can be performed on the data without specifying how these operations are implemented. It is actually what you see before the data structure.

For example, You can create an ADT stack, which can push an element, pop an element and check if the element is present.That is the behaviour we expect. But when it comes to Data Structure, it may be a stack implemented using arrays, stack implemented using linked list, so many types, which comes under the hood of ADT. What the user sees is the ADT.
