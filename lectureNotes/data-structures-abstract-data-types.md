# Introduction to Data Structures and Abstract Data Types

**Data Structures:**

- Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently.
- There are many data structures available to store and manipulate the data depending on the requirement.
- Common data structures include lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
  -Different data structures make certain operations more efficient than others

**Abstract Data Types(ADTs):**

- An Abstract Data Type is an abstract concept that defines a data type by its behavior (what operations can be performed on it) rather than by its implementation.
- ADTs can be implemented using different data structures, and the implementation may vary depending on the requirements of the program.
- One of the important ADTs used frequently are stacks, queues, tree, graph, the implementation of trees can be BST, AVL tree etc.
